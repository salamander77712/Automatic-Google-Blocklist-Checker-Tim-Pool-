# Automatic-Google-Blocklist-Checker-Tim-Pool
Running the executable file in the dist folder will automatically search google for "Tim Pool," "Timcast," "Tim Pool YouTube," and "Timcast YouTube"
The program will then output the first 25 search results for each search query and tally how many of those results actually link to
one of Tim's YouTube channels
# Note
Google and Windows will be very unhappy with you trying to download and run a random .exe file. If you have python installed on your computer, you should be able to run the TimScore.py file instead. You must also have the tkinter, googlesearch, and socket libraries installed on your computer.
# Note 2
Running the .exe will create a google-cookie text file. This is a result of the Google Search API. You should delete this file after running the .exe because it does nothing but take up space.
