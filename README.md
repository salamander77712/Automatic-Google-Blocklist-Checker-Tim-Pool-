# Automatic-Google-Blocklist-Checker-Tim-Pool
Running the executable file in the dist folder will automatically search google for "Tim Pool," "Timcast," "Tim Pool YouTube," and "Timcast YouTube"
The program will then output the first 25 search results for each search query and tally how many of those results actually link to
one of Tim's YouTube channels
